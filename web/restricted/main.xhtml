                            Companies developing and maintaining complex software 
                            systems need to determine the features that should be 
                            added to their system as part of the next release. 
                            They will wish to select these features to ensure 
                            the demands of their client base are satisfied as 
                            much as possible while at the same time ensuring 
                            that they themselves have the resources to undertake 
                            the necessary development. This situation is modelled 
                            in this paper and the problem of selecting an optimal
                            next release is shown to be NP-hard. The use of various 
                            modern heuristics to find a high quality but possibly 
                            suboptimal solution is described. Comparative studies 
                            of these heuristics are given for various test cases.
