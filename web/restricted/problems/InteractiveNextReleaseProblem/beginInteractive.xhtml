                        This is a <b>semi-automatic</b> strategy to select requirements. 
                        Not only select the requirements based on their cost and importance values, but also, it incorporates
                        your subjective evaluation about next release planning. Your role is to evaluate a set of at least <b>10 initial solutions</b> which will help the approach to learn your evaluation profile. After, the Stop button will be active. You can evaluate more solutions before
                        stopping if you wish. The more you evaluate, the better the machine learning algorithm will incorporate
                        your preferences at the final solution. After clicking on the Stop button, you have to evaluate the Final Solution considering the Interactive Approach will be shown. This solution was
                        built considering both overall clients satisfaction and your subjective preferences.
